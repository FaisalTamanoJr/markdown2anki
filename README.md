## Objectives

**Main design goal: easy to install, learn, and use**

1. To be able to easily convert markdown notes to a file that can easily be imported in Anki via the command line.
2. Markdown notes structure **should strictly follow** the structure I define.
3. The template for the notes should be intuitive and easy to use. It being Anki-convertable shouldn’t compromise it’s readability and conduciveness for learning.
4. It shouldn’t be difficult to install/setup.
5. It has an isolated design, that is, a converted deck corresponds to a single lesson.
6. It **only utilizes Basic and Cloze**, thereby image-occlusion will not be taken into account.
7. It is intentionally not flexible: **minimal or no configuration** options will be provided. Output should be very predictable.
